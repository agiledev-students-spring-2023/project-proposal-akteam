### Project title

***OpenEdu***

### What and why?

Computer Science is one of the most popular majors across the world and one of the most prominent fields for career and academic research.

The resource for one to learn any aspect of CS is, without doubt, more than abundant, but two problems come with the abundance itself: where to start and what to choose.

**OpenEdu** is aiming to offer a clear learning path with solid material from well-known Universities around the world for people who are overwhelmed as a beginner.

### For whom?

There are two types of people the OpenEdu is mainly serving to: Computer Science students who are required to learn a broad range of topics related to CS, and people in CS-related industries like Database Management Systems and SDE as a whole. 

For students, their schools do not necessarily offer the best curriculum with sufficient infrastructures like labs and assignments that can effectively improve their overall understanding of certain fields: OpenEdu collects well-known courses worldwide to flatten their learning curve and offer well-rounded learning resources. 

For people in the industry, OpenEdu can be treated as a platform to have a complete review of certain filed's most fundamental knowledge and a good introduction collections of the fields one would like to know about.

### How?

There will be three major systems that the platform will offer:

- Course System: 
    1. A user can choose from subjects that he or she is interested in, like Data Structure, Operating Systems, and so on;
    2. In each subject there will be multiple courses the user can choose from. Like MIT S6.081 and Berkeley CS162 are both for OS; 
    3. On the course page, there will be a short introduction to the course along with prerequisites, languages the course uses, estimated time to complete the course work, and so on.
    4. On the course page, the videos for the lectures will be offered, along with the official page for the course and reference repos or other sites that may benefit the learner;
    5. On the main page, there will be recommended courses that the user might be interested in.
   
   
- User System:
    1. A user can register an account for the platform to unlock more features, but one is not required to register to watch videos;
    2. Under each video, users can share comments, which can be deleted, liked, disliked, and replied to;
    3. On the home page of a user, he or she can change the bio, contact information;
    4. The user can write Markdown blogs: the home page is aiming to be a Blog site for the user that can share knowledge with the public;
    5. The user can add a course to the favorite list;
    6. The user can give suggestions to us, offer website advice, or recommend new courses that the user finds good.

- Community System:
    1. For each subject, there is a "community" page that is used as a discussion board;
    2. Users can ask for helps with technical issues and questions derived from the courses and find study buddies, which is similar to a simplified Reddit.



### Scope

The three systems above intertwine a lot, which requires careful and sophisticated designs of the database model and page path. But currently, we have 5 people in the group and most of us have full-stack development experience, the project would be challenging yet not unachievable.
