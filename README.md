## III. What and why?

Computer Science is one of the most popular majors across the world and one of the most prominent fields for career and academic research.
Although it is easy to learn coding from online resources nowadays, finding an all-in-one application to learn, discuss and implement can sometimes be cumbersome.

**OpenEdu** is a one-stop shop enabling CS students and enthusiasts of all skill levels to learn CS via materials from well-known universities, discuss with others, and contribute knowledge to the platform.

## IV. For whom?

OpenEdu is designed for the following audience:

- **Computer Science students** who are required to learn a broad range of topics related to CS
- **people in CS-related industries** like Database Management Systems and SDE as a whole. 

For students, their schools do not necessarily offer the best curriculum with sufficient infrastructures like labs and assignments that can effectively improve their overall understanding of certain fields: OpenEdu collects well-known courses worldwide to flatten their learning curve and offer well-rounded learning resources. 

For people in the industry, OpenEdu can serve as a platform to have a complete review of certain filed's most fundamental knowledge and a good introduction collections of the fields one would like to know about.

## V. How?

The platform is composed of three modules: 

1. Course Module:

    - A user can choose from subjects that he or she is interested in, like Data Structure, Operating Systems, and so on
    - In each subject, there will be multiple courses the user can choose from. 
        - e.g. MIT's ``S6.081`` and UC Berkeley's ``CS162`` are both for Operating Systems
    - On the course page, there will be a short introduction to the course along with prerequisites, languages the course uses, estimated time to complete the course work, and so on
    - On the course page, the videos for the lectures will be offered, along with the official page for the course and reference repositories or other sites that may benefit the learner
    - On the main page, there will be recommended courses that the user might be interested in.
   
2. User Module:

    - A user can register an account for the platform to unlock more features, but one is not required to register to watch videos
    - Under each video, users can share comments, which can be deleted, liked, disliked, and replied to
    - On the home page of a user, he or she can change the bio, contact information
    - The user can write Markdown blogs: the home page is aiming to be a Blog site for the user that can share knowledge with the public
    - The user can add a course to the favorite list
    - The user can give suggestions to us, offer website advice, or recommend new courses that the user finds good.

3. Community Module:

    - For each subject, there is a "community" page that is used as a discussion board
    - Users can ask for helps with technical issues and questions derived from the courses and find study buddies (similar to a simplified version of *Reddit*).


## VI. Scope

The three systems above intertwine a lot, which requires careful and sophisticated designs of the database model and page path. But currently, we have 5 people in the group and most of us have full-stack development experience, the project would be challenging yet not unachievable.
